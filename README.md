# Multithreaded-Shortest-Path-Server-Client
This project implements a **multithreaded server** and a **client** in **C++** for computing the **shortest path** between two nodes in an undirected graph. The server handles each client request in a separate thread and communicates using TCP sockets. It also implements a caching mechanism for better performance.
